# FunQi - Function Quality Intelligence

FunQi (Function Quality Intelligence) is a **machine learning-powered platform** that evaluates Python functions based on multiple code quality metrics. It provides **automated code quality scores** and **improvement suggestions**, making it useful for developers, software teams, and educators.

##  Features
-  **Code Quality Analysis**: Extracts features like **cyclomatic complexity, modularity, function naming, comment quality, and more** from function.
-  **Machine Learning-Powered**: Uses **trained ML models** (Random Forest) for accurate predictions of code quality score (out of 10).
-  **Detailed Feedback**: Provides suggestions to improve **code readability, maintainability, and efficiency**.

##  Architecture & Approach
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Identification & Goal
Current platforms focus on rule-based analysis or syntax correctness. FunQi aims to **predict code quality dynamically** using machine learning.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Creation
- Built a dataset with **six key parameters**: Cyclomatic Complexity, Loops, Function Length, Modularity, Comment Quality, and Naming Quality.
- Assigned an **ideal quality score** based on these parameters for supervised learning.
- [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nvn4jOvwmp0ijSLLtM7MOP0PMaFW076m/view?usp=drive_link)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing & Model Training
- Used **MinMaxScaler** for normalization.
- Correlation analysis to validate meaningful features.
- Trained multiple ML models (Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, KNN) and selected the best performer.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Algorithm for Metric Calculations
- Extracts **AST-based** metrics using **Radon** and **custom Python functions**.
- **NLP techniques** (NLTK) for analyzing **comment quality** and **function names**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Web App & API Development
- **Backend**: Flask API for model inference.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for UI.
- **Testing**: Verified API responses using **Postman**.

### [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rudwVcTvoRlXZkE-sqgYI8HrD5Q_-e5A/view?usp=sharing)

For a poorly written function a score of 2.78 is given with following suggestions:
